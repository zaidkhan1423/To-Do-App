# Overview
### This Android application is a simple To-Do list manager that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. The app is built using modern Android development technologies such as Room DB, Coroutines, Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack Compose for UI, and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Clean Architecture principles.

# Features
### Task Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.
### Room Database: Utilizes Room Persistence Library for local data storage and management.
### Coroutines: Asynchronous programming is done using Kotlin Coroutines for efficient and non-blocking operations.
### Hilt: Dependency injection is implemented using Hilt for better code organization and testability.
### Jetpack Compose: The app UI is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for Android development, providing a declarative and efficient way to build UI.
### MVVM Architecture: The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern, separating concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers.
### Clean Architecture: The app architecture is designed based on Clean Architecture principles, promoting separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
